## H43

I started this project thinking about fun tools to make to prank my friends although this looks like a devil's one.

I know people might use this for bad purposes but that's not my fault, I only have the intention to share my project with you. The ones that must be careful are the server's owners.

You might be asking why I didn't put Mass DM as a command since that is such a recognized one. The answer is obvious... This wasn't made to annoy everyone in a server but to "prank" friend's server....

If you want you can give me feedback for me to improve. One of the reasons I built this was to learn programming (the other reason is above xD). When I have time I'll try to make this code better :D

**Please read the last part at least if you want to skip the steps** 

# Steps

I. **Create a Discord Bot**

```Acess ```[this website](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)```, create a Discord Bot and copy the Token given```

website: ```https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/```

II. **Install Python 3.6+**

III. **Install dependencies**

```Run this command in terminal (e.g CMD): pip install -U discord.py```
```If error shows up try: python -m pip install -U discord.py```
```If still show the same error ('command not recognized') u need to add python to your system variable```

IV. **Open config.json and edit** (Maybe notepadd++)

```In "exploit_users" you must replace 000000000000000000 with your ID and add as many as you want. These exploit_users are the users that have acess to your bot's commands. Note: You need to enable Developer mode! Note: You need to remove all 0's numbers. All ID's must be followed by a comma (,) except the last one```

```In "cooldown_bypass" you can either set true or false (lower case). There is a cooldown in each command so you don't abuse them thinking it didn't work. If you want u can replace the false by true anytime you want.```

```In "offline_mode" you can either set true or false (lower case). Even if you set it to true it wont change bot's status if another instance of the bot is running. It will only not make bot's status online.```

```In "token" you can either write the token (inside quotation marks, e.g "your_token_here") or write null or even "" (default) if you don't want to write the token inside the file you can write it when the bot starts up however, you will have to paste in terminal everytime you start the bot```


V. **Start Script**

```Run Start.bat or execute h43.py with python```

VI. **Paste the token in the terminal**

```You can skip this step if you wrote the token inside the config.json```

VII. **Invite the Bot to the server (Persuade them to invite your bot)

````https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=ID&permissions=8    -  If you think people never add bots that has permission 8 (administrator) just change it to another number that has the same permissions (e.g Administrator + every other = Administrator n.º = 2146958847)```

VII. **Check Help for commands**

```If you write H43?help in bot's DM or in a server where the bot is, it will DM you with the help (commands)```

## Warnings:
Use this at your own risk. Your bot can be banned and user too.

Please don't try to destroy people lives... 
For last, have fun!
