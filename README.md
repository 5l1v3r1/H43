## H43

I started this project thinking about fun tools to make to prank my friends although this looks like a devil's one.
I know people might use this for bad purposes but that's not my fault, I only have the intention to share my project with you. The ones that must be careful are the server's owners.
You might be asking why didn't I put Mass DM as a command since that is such a recognized one. The answer is obvious... This wasn't made to annoy everyone in a server but to "prank" a friend's server....

#Steps
I. **Create a Discord Bot**
```Acess ```[this website](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)```, create a Discord Bot and copy the Token given```

website: ```https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/```

II. **Install Python 3.6+**

III. **Install dependencies**
```Run this command in terminal (e.g CMD): pip install -U -r requirements.txt```

IV. **Open config.json and edit**
```In "cooldown_bypass" you can either set true or false (lower case). There is a cooldown in each command so you don't abuse them thinking it didn't work. If you want u can replace the false by true anytime you want.```
```In "exploit_users" you can replace 000000000000000000 with your ID and add as many as you want.```

V. **Start Script**
```Run Start.bat or execute h43.py with python```

VI. **Check Help for commands**
```If you write H43?help in bot's DM or in a server where the bot is, it will DM you with the help (commands)```

## Remember:
Use this at your own risk. Your bot can be banned and user too.

Please don't try to destroy people lives... 
For last, have fun!
